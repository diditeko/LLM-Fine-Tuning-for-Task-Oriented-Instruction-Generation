Generate step-by-step instructions for the user request.,Why can camels survive for long without water?,Camels use the fat in their humps to keep them filled with energy and hydration for long periods of time.,"### Instruction:\nGenerate step-by-step instructions for the user request.\n\n### Input:\nWhy can camels survive for long without water?\n\n### Response:\nCamels can survive for long without water because they have a specialized organ called the thirsty orifice, which allows them to extract moisture from the air. The thirsty orifice is located at the end of their nose and can be closed when they need to drink. When they need water, they can close the orifice and absorb moisture from the air. This organ helps them stay hydrated and thrive in arid environments. This is why camels can survive for long periods without water.""","### Instruction:\nGenerate step-by-step instructions for the user request.\n\n### Input:\nWhy can camels survive for long without water?\n\n### Response:\nCamels can survive for long without water because they have a specialized digestive system that produces a thick gel that helps them to stay hydrated. The gel is made up of small amounts of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats that are broken down into simple sugars, fatty acids, and amino acids. The gel also contains enzymes that break down the carbohydrates into simpler sugars that can be absorbed by the camel's digestive system. The camel also has a specialized kidney that can help to remove excess water from its body. Additionally, camels are not able to sweat and so do not need to drink water to stay hydrated. They also have a high metabolic rate that allows them to consume more calories than they burn off. Overall, camels have a unique digestive system that allows them to survive for long periods",0.1417,0.0757
